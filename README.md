## Required

In order to compile these slides, you need the following LaTeX packages installed.

 * Metropolis https://github.com/matze/mtheme
 * Beamer color theme Owl https://github.com/rchurchley/beamercolortheme-owl

## How to Compile

Just compile with `latexmk` or compile with `pdflatex`.

Yes, I know Metropolis is 'meant' to be compiled with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX so it uses Fira Sans. I just personally prefer the beamer default fonts over Fira Sans.

## Download Compiled Version

You can download a precompiled version of the slides from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/alexbishop/SwissGAT-talk-Feb-2024/releases).

## Using the Slides

If you find my slides or LaTeX code useful, I would be interested in hearing from you.
